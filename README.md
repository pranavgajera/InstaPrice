## Deliverables
We aim to deliver a price history application that is accessible from the browser. The application will provide a login where users can log in and check the price history of a certain product (for example a camera). The response will then be posted in the timeline (the historical price of that camera in the form of a graph) which will stay persistent so that other users could check what other users have searched for.

## Motivation
Although there are quite a few applications that track the price history of products, we’ve found that there is a lack of social media integration with these apps, we want to create a web application where users can not only look at the price history of the products they want but also be able to share the search they did through the application to other users.

## Approach
We’ll be building a web app using Flask in the backend and React/JS in the frontend, tied together using Socket.io. The app will feature social login via Google, and be deployed on Heroku. We will use either the eBay or amazon API to collect pricing data. Depending on the return types of the API’s, we will also use a python library to convert the datasets into images we can display.

## Dependencies and risks
* We researched the eBay and amazon API’s, and will use any API fulfilling a similar role. The core feature of our app will rely on the chosen API.
* Finally, as our app is deployed on Heroku, we have a hard dependency on Heroku functioning for our app to work.
* Scaling will be concerning as the user base gets large, the free storage from Heroku might not be enough to handle all the data.

## Sprint Milestones
### *Milestone 1 - MVP*
The base of the app is the core price checking functionality that allows multiple users to post price histories of items to a common timeline. Users will be able to do this by searching for an item, and finding the item on a list of all relevant items returned by our search. This is captured in the set of mvp user stories above, and is what we aim to have fully finished by this checkpoint. Since we need to figure out which API’s allow us to best find such price data on items, we anticipate this milestone to be unpolished, which will be fixed by the second milestone.
### *Milestone 2 - Polish*
Building on the above, we’d like to add styling to the page to make it look like the mockups presented in the above section. We’d also like to add one more section in the response received by the application after the user searches for a product with a graph section in the search results based on the price history data received from the user search.  We’d also like to add some sorting options on the profile of the user and also the timeline in the main page of the application where the old posts shared by the users are presented.
